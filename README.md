# CS5590-PYTHON-DL-LAB3
For lab 3

# TO RUN PART 3:
You have to download the natural_images dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images  
This was not included because it's around 170 MB and would take a very long time to push to Github.  
Extract it and put it in the same folder as part 3, then part 3 will be able to run.
